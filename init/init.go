// The init functions are called in the order they are defined in the file.
// One of the problems with package-level variables or init is that you canâ€™t return
// error values. If you have an error in init, the best course of action is to panic
// and not continue execution in a bad state. To support that, some of the Go
// packages provide a Must version of their New functions
